Raised primarily by his mother and grandmother in Prince George's County, Maryland, Durant's passion for basketball led him from a standout high school career to playing one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, where he was the first freshman named Naismith College Player of the Year. Drafted second overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2007, Durant's NBA journey included significant tenures with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets, and the Phoenix Suns. Off the court, Durant is noted for his philanthropy, business ventures, and media presence, including a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross and involvement in various charitable activities.

It is about 2.4 times the size of Earth, with an unclear composition, and orbits a G-class star similar to our sun but smaller and colder, with an orbit of 290 days.3. **Kepler-69c** - Approximately 2,700 light-years away, Kepler-69c is around 70% larger than Earth, with an uncertain composition.
