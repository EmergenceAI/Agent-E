This approach is speculative and depends on the website's URL structure being consistent and predictable for dictionary entries.\n\nRevised Plan:\n1. Attempt to directly access the \"altruism\" entry by modifying the current URL in a way that might directly lead to the \"altruism\" page, based on the assumption of a consistent URL structure for word entries.\n2. If this approach is successful, locate and report the definition of \"altruism.\"\n3. Locate and report the UK pronunciation.\n4. Locate and report the US pronunciation.\n5. Find and report one example sentence for the word \"altruism.\"\n6. Verify that all requested information (definition, both pronunciations, and example sentence) has been accurately reported.\n\nNext step: Since direct manipulation of the URL by the helper is not within the scope of capabilities, and given the limitations encountered, it appears we've exhausted the viable approaches to accessing the specific entry for \"altruism\" on the Cambridge Dictionary website through the methods available to the helper.\n\nAt this point, without the ability to directly interact with search functionality, navigate effectively through the alphabetical index to \"altruism,\" or manipulate URLs, we've reached the limit of what can be accomplished given the constraints.",

Raised primarily by his mother and grandmother in Prince George's County, Maryland, Durant's passion for basketball led him from a standout high school career to playing one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, where he was the first freshman named Naismith College Player of the Year. Drafted second overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2007, Durant's NBA journey included significant tenures with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets, and the Phoenix Suns. Off the court, Durant is noted for his philanthropy, business ventures, and media presence, including a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross and involvement in various charitable activities. His personal life, especially his close relationship with his mother, has also been a focal point of his public persona.",

It is about 2.4 times the size of Earth, with an unclear composition, and orbits a G-class star similar to our sun but smaller and colder, with an orbit of 290 days.3. **Kepler-69c** - Approximately 2,700 light-years away, Kepler-69c is around 70% larger than Earth, with an uncertain composition.
