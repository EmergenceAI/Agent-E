The abstract discusses the critical role of evaluation benchmarks in assessing the progress of large language models (LLMs). It points out the often overlooked aspect of variance in these benchmarks, which is essential for determining the significance of performance differences. The study introduces metrics for measuring benchmark variance, including seed variance and monotonicity during training, and provides empirical estimates through the analysis of numerous models. It also examines the impact of different performance measures and proposes methods to reduce variance, highlighting that simple adjustments can significantly affect smaller models. The paper emphasizes the need for careful consideration of variance in model comparisons and contributes to better benchmarking practices in machine learning research.",

Here's a summary of the central points:\n\n1. **Purpose of the Law**: The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires companies to ensure their supply chains do not contribute to environmental harm or utilize forced labour, aiming to enforce adherence to environmental and human rights standards.\n\n2. **Scope and Impact on European Companies**: The law applies to larger businesses with at least 1,000 employees and a net turnover of \u20ac450m, significantly reducing the number of companies under its jurisdiction and exempting almost 70% of European companies.\n\n3. **Economic Implications and Industry Concerns**: European businesses have expressed concerns about increased bureaucracy, legal risks, and the potential for companies to relocate outside the EU, criticizing the new rules for imposing \"unparalleled obligations\" and exposing them to global litigation.\n\n4. **Reactions and Criticisms**: While the legislation has been welcomed by environmental and human rights campaigners, critics argue that compromises made have weakened its effectiveness in addressing forced labour and environmental issues, with significant concerns over the law's quality being compromised to appease big business interests.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: The draft legislation requires approval from the European Parliament to become law, with businesses given time to implement the new practices. The approval process follows two failed attempts, with objections from countries concerned about the impact on their industries.\n\nThis article highlights the EU's steps towards greater corporate accountability in supply chains, though its effectiveness remains questioned due to compromises during the negotiation process.",

Key points include:- **China and India's Position**: Both are significant greenhouse gas emitters advocating for financial support due to vulnerable communities within their borders, despite being major economies.- **Loss and Damage Fund**: Established at COP27, this fund is meant to assist poorer nations impacted by irreversible climate-related damages.- **Funding and Contributions**: Debate exists over who should contribute, with developed countries suggesting that China and India, due to their emissions and economic growth, should also contribute.- **Eligibility and Tensions**: The eligibility for funding and the source of the fund's finances remain contentious issues, with a focus on the moral responsibility of major economies to engage with the fund.This report highlights the complexities and debates surrounding financial contributions and responsibilities in addressing climate change impacts.",

This technology uses a liquid desiccant to absorb moisture from the air, which is then heated using sunlight or renewable electricity to release the moisture, condensing it into drinking water. Each unit is capable of producing about 2,000 liters of drinking water daily. Initially aimed at supplying drinking water to communities facing shortages, the company has shifted its focus to the hospitality industry due to financial viability issues. The atmospheric water generation market, valued at $3.4 billion in 2022, is expected to grow to $13.5 billion by 2032, highlighting the potential of this technology to address global water scarcity issues.",

The Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast were expected to be the worst-affected areas, with record-breaking temperatures possible. Additionally, a wildfire north of Los Angeles, California, forced evacuations, and preparations were underway for the first tropical storm of the season, Alberto, which could impact the Gulf Coast, southern Mexico, and parts of Central America. Parts of Montana experienced rare June snow due to an NWS winter storm warning.",

Examples include:\n  - Affirmative: \"I have worked.\"\n  - Negative: \"I have not worked.\"\n  - Interrogative: \"Have I worked?\"\n\n- **Uses**: This tense is used to describe actions or events that have relevance to the present moment. It encompasses:\n  - Experiences: \"I\u2019ve seen \u2018Buddy\u2019.\"\n  - Recent completed events without a specific time: \"Niki and John have just come back from a week in Spain.\"\n  - Past events with present results: \"She\u2019s broken her arm.\"\n  - Durations with \"for\" and \"since\": \"That house on the corner has been empty for three years.\"\n\n- **Time expressions**: Commonly associated with the present perfect simple are expressions like \"ever,\" \"never,\" \"before,\" \"so far,\" \"up until now,\" \"just,\" \"recently,\" \"yet,\" \"already,\" and \"still.\"\n\n- **Introducing past time events**: It is used in news contexts to introduce recent past events, with further details often provided in the past simple tense.\n\n- **Differences in American English**: Notably, American English may use the past simple in places where British English would use the present perfect simple, particularly with \"already\" and \"yet.\"\n\nThis comprehensive overview from the Cambridge Grammar page provides a clear understanding of the present perfect simple tense, its formation, uses, and the nuances between British and American English usage.",

His career highlights include two NBA championships (2017, 2018), an NBA Most Valuable Player Award (2014), two Finals MVP Awards, and 14 NBA All-Star game selections. Durant has won three gold medals with the U.S. men's national team in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020), becoming the all-time scorer in men's Olympic basketball history for Team USA. Raised primarily by his mother and grandmother in Prince George's County, Maryland, Durant's passion for basketball led him from a standout high school career to playing one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, where he was the first freshman named Naismith College Player of the Year. Drafted second overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2007, Durant's NBA journey included significant tenures with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets, and the Phoenix Suns. Off the court, Durant is noted for his philanthropy, business ventures, and media presence, including a $1 million donation to the American Red Cross and involvement in various charitable activities. His personal life, especially his close relationship with his mother, has also been a focal point of his public persona.",

It is in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star, which is cooler than the sun, but its proximity to the star may expose it to flares from the red dwarf.2. **Kepler-22b** - Situated 600 light-years away, Kepler-22b was the first Kepler planet found in the habitable zone of its parent star. It is about 2.4 times the size of Earth, with an unclear composition, and orbits a G-class star similar to our sun but smaller and colder, with an orbit of 290 days.3. **Kepler-69c** - Approximately 2,700 light-years away, Kepler-69c is around 70% larger than Earth, with an uncertain composition. It completes one orbit every 242 days, placing it in a position within its solar system comparable to Venus within ours.
